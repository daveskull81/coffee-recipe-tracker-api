# API Documentation

Base URL: `DEPLOYED_URL/api`

Checking this in a browser or making a `GET` request to it directly should return a `JSON` object like this:  
```
{
    status: 'SUCCESS'
}
```
## Authentication  

All endpoints except for `Login` and `Register` will require Authentication by the client. Any client (web or mobile) will need to authenticate their requests by placing a token as the value for the `Authorization` header.
A `token` property is returned in the response on both the `Login` and `Register` requests with the token for that specific user. The token does not expire for 1 day.

The token for a user can only be used to performs actions on resources for that user specifically. Requests made to resources owned by a user from a token generated by a different user will receive the `401` status code. In the response will be an object with a `message` property.

Example  
```
{ message: 'Access to this data is unauthorized' }
```  

## Errors  

When errors occur with the requests a json object will be returned with both a `message` property and an `error` property. They will each contain information on what error occurred.  
```
{
    message: <ERROR_MESSAGE_TEXT_STRING>,
    error: <ADDITIONAL_ERROR_DATA_TEXT_STRING>
}
```
